# fast_cgi_qt
A basic implementation of the fastcgi protocol in Qt.

## Abstract

This library allows your Qt application to interface with webserver using the fastcgi protocol.
This can be seen as an alternative to embedding a webserver into the application itself and
takes the program out of the first line of attack if used on the public internet.
